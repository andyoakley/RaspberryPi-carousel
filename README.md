RaspberryPi-carousel
====================
Scripts to use a Raspberry Pi to run an automated display such as a slide-show
of images, snap shots of web sites, or other interesting information. Great
for ambient displays of information.

A simple script is run on one or more Raspberry Pi devices connected to a 
display. The Pi does not initiate contact but instead waits to have content
pushed to it.

An example server side script is used to create snapshots of web pages using
[IEsnapper](https://github.com/andyoakley/IEsnapper).
